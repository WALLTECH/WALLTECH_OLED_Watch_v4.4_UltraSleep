WALLTECH_OLED_Watch_v4.4_UltraSleep

v4.4 of the WΛLLTΞCH OLED Watch fixes previous design errors, thins the watch to a mere 13mm in its case, and adds an ambient light sensor for adaptive display brightness. It incorporates a .96" OLED display, a rechargeable 250mAh LiPo battery that lasts up to 2.5 weeks thanks to the watch’s UltraSleep mode, a FemtoduinoUSB with micro usb charging and programming, accurate temperature sensing, ambient light level detection, 3 input buttons, 3 indicator LEDs, and an on/off switch.

To build one yourself, either download the Gerber files to have a PCB made with your favorite manufacturer, or head to OSHPark, the best PCB manufacturer for US Makers and my preferred choice for all my PCBs, and have my design built in glorious gold and purple here - https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/jhyZbj4B Once your PCB arrives, look to the BOM (Bill Of Materials) and source the parts to build the watch.

To program the watch once you've built it, you can download the Arduino libraries in the "Software" folder and compile and upload the watch sketch as an Arduino UNO on the serial port that appears when you plug it in, or you can use codebender.cc to program the watch with one click in browser! Cool! - https://codebender.cc/sketch:122702

Enjoy your new watch! If the source-yourself approach isn't for you (yet), I might sell these as kits if there's enough interest. If you'd like to see this as a kit, email me at john@walltech.cc!
